<tr><td valign=top>2001-12-06</td><td>Finished documenting policing filters,
added short piece on Generic Random Early Detection queueing.

This is a major release and as such some things are changing. We are no
longer the '2.4 HOWTO', the canonical name now is 'Linux Advanced Routing
&amp; Shaping HOWTO', the canonical URL is <a
href=http://ds9a.nl/lartc>http://ds9a.nl/lartc</a>. Bumped the version
number to 0.9.0. Now is the time to help us spot mistakes, I'm going to push
the HOWTO to the LDP somewhere next week, I want it to be perfect then. Oh,
and we re-licensed under the Open Publication License, which increases
your freedom as a user.
<tr><td valign=top>2001-12-03</td><td>All other queueing disciplines are now
documented as well. Furthermore, '<a
href=http://ds9a.nl/lartc/HOWTO//cvs/2.4routing/output/2.4routing-12.html>hashed filtered
queueing</a>' (last section) is also
explained. Some chapters were shuffled, this chapter is mostly new:
<a
href=http://ds9a.nl/lartc/HOWTO/cvs/2.4routing/output/2.4routing-14.html>14.
Advanced & less common queueing disciplines</a>. Chapter 9 was improved a
lot too. Only policing filters are next!
</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2001-12-01</td><td>CBQ is now nearly completely
documented. And how shaping works in general as well. Big reorganization.

time, a <a

dark unexplored reaches of my mailbox, which had been there for 2 months.
I'm terribly sorry about this.</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2000-05-26</td><td>Abandoned the 2.4 Networking HOWTO and merged
useful content back into the Advanced HOWTO. I feel bad about this, but the
2.4 Networking HOWTO was not taking off. If anybody feels like it, please
take over. The good news is that the Shaping HOWTO is still progressing and
appears to be very popular.</td>
