<a href=http://www.intuh.net/opt-out/>this page</a> or the <a

addresses of known opt-in spam supporters!</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2002-07-07</td><td>Moved the IRC channel #lartc to
irc.oftc.net - a very down to earth IRC network without operators begging
for financial support. If you are new to IRC, give it a try. An excellent
irc client is <a href=http://www.irssi.org>irssi</a>. IRC archives
will be back soon!</td>

new</a> <a href=http://outpost.ds9a.nl>one</a>. We are very confident that we will now be up &gt;99%.</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2002-04-15</td><td><a href=wondershaper/>Wondershaper
1.1</a> released</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2002-04-11</td><td>Thanks to <a

Leeuwen</a> we finally have <a
href=http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.rpdb.multiple-links.html>
a good section on how to combine multiple
internet links succesfully</a>. Today is also <font color=#ff0000>FLAG
DAY!</font> I've shifted to DocBook and all 'deep links' are now dead. 
The good news is that DocBook has features to make deep links more robust, 
so expect some nice URLs soon.</a></td>
<tr><td valign=top>2002-03-15</td><td>Psssst! Sneak preview of what I've
been doing the past year and a half or so: the <a
href=http://pdns.powerdns.com>PowerDNS not-for-profit release</a>. In other
news, the tea crisis has subsided. Family went to the UK and brought a
year's supply of tea.</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2002-03-10</td><td>Started migration to DocBook! I think
the <a href=lartc.pdf>PDF</a> looks a lot better. The <a
href=docbook-html>HTML</a> isn't bad either. <a href=lartc.txt>Text</a> needs
some work though. Let <a href=mailto:ahu@ds9a.nl>me</a> know what you think!</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2002-02-23</td><td>Moved to <a
href=http://lartc.org>lartc.org</a>!</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2002-02-19</td><td>Spam. Due to a broken IPv6 patch, our
postfix has been an open relay somewhere in January. It was fixed promptly,
but we're still trying to get out of a lot of spamlists.
Relays.osirusoft.com keeps on listing us, we hope they will get round to
removing us soon. This may be the cause of mail not arriving. I'm trying to
move postfix to another local interface, stay tuned. <font
color=#ff0000>Update: </font>We are now no longer listed as an open relay,
but as a 'testblocker' now, which is weird, but mail should be arriving
again!</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2002-02-07</td><td>Back from holiday. Bought lartc.org, 
will bring it in service soon. New <a
href=http://mr0vka.eu.org/tlumaczenia/2.4routing.html>Polish
translation!</a></td>
<tr><td valign=top>2002-01-13</td><td>Downtime. I returned home yesterday
evening in what might be described as a 'highly entertained' state and
accidentally shut down <a href=http://outpost.powerdns.com>outpost</a>
instead of my laptop. Also, I'm on holiday from beginning this week until
early February. So expect some silence.</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2002-01-04</td><td>We now have a favicon! Stolen from <a
href=http://www.kernel.org>www.kernel.org</a>. In other news, I've been
painting the <a href=http://ds9a.nl>house</a> and I'm busy at <a
href=http://www.powerdns.com>work</a> so it has been a bit quiet. But I'm
still there, don't worry.</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2001-12-10</td><td>Added <a
href=http://lartc.org/HOWTO//cvs/2.4routing/html/x1886.html>The Wonder
Shaper</a>, which allows you to retain very low latency while doing very
fast up- and downloads. You can even do both at the same time, but then
latency suffers. Added <a href=dejairc.php>logs
for the irc channel</a> which is already seeing some traffic.</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2001-12-10</td><td>The <a
href=manpages/>manpages</a> now include a huge CBQ page. Read it and weep.</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2001-12-09</td><td>We now have an IRC channel, #lartc on
<a href=http://www.openprojects.net>irc.openprojects.net</a>. Join #lartc
to chat about Linux &amp; Routing &amp; Shaping!</td>

<tr><td valign=top>2001-12-06</td><td>Finished documenting policing filters,
added short piece on Generic Random Early Detection queueing.

This is a major release and as such some things are changing. We are no
longer the '2.4 HOWTO', the canonical name now is 'Linux Advanced Routing
&amp; Shaping HOWTO', the canonical URL is <a
href=http://ds9a.nl/lartc>http://ds9a.nl/lartc</a>. Bumped the version
number to 0.9.0. Now is the time to help us spot mistakes, I'm going to push
the HOWTO to the LDP somewhere next week, I want it to be perfect then. Oh,
and we re-licensed under the Open Publication License, which increases
your freedom as a user.
<tr><td valign=top>2001-12-03</td><td>All other queueing disciplines are now
documented as well. Furthermore, '<a
href=http://ds9a.nl/lartc/HOWTO//cvs/2.4routing/output/2.4routing-12.html>hashed filtered
queueing</a>' (last section) is also
explained. Some chapters were shuffled, this chapter is mostly new:
<a
href=http://ds9a.nl/lartc/HOWTO/cvs/2.4routing/output/2.4routing-14.html>14.
Advanced & less common queueing disciplines</a>. Chapter 9 was improved a
lot too. Only policing filters are next!
</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2001-12-01</td><td>CBQ is now nearly completely
documented. And how shaping works in general as well. Big reorganization.
Read all about it <a
href=http://ds9a.nl/lartc/HOWTO//cvs/2.4routing/output/2.4routing-9.html>here</a>!

<tr><td valign=top>2001-11-28</td><td>Lecture was given to a pretty full
room, read more about it <a
href=http://ds9a.nl/cbq-presentation>here</a>.</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2001-11-22</td><td>Mailinglist has been back for a while
and is in full swing again. Server broken again, due to crappy 1U case
design we are seeing CPU temperatures of 80C. In contact with vendor. Bert
Hubert will be giving a lecture about CBQ during this year's <a
href=http://www.linux-kongress.de>Linux Kongress</a>

</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2001-09-11</td><td><a
href=http://outpost.powerdns.com>New server</a>! If you can read this, it
works. Expect the mailinglist to return shortly.
</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2001-09-09</td><td><a href=/404.html>Server still
broken</a>,
supplier has so far managed to ship a broken system twice. New hardware has
just arrived, so we hope to be back soon.. Apologies for having the
mailinglist down for so long...
</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2001-07-17</td><td><a href=/404.html>Our server broke
down, badly</a>. Mailinglist defunct. Very unhappy</td>

document</a> about 'auto loadbalancing'. Might become a chapter, or a separate project one
day</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2001-07-13</td><td>Bert, Jasper and Remco will attend <a
href=http://www.hal2001.org>HAL2001</a>, a hackers conference. We're all in
the FHQ committee who are arranging for the 1gbit/s internet uplink on the
campground, we look forward to seeing you there!</td>

<tr><td valign=top>2001-03-11</td><td>Information on Path MTU Discovery
problems, and more obscure settings documented</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2001-02-09</td><td>Some new additions, but the major news
is that our PDFs finally look good! Get our Makefile and see how it is
done. To celebrate, we bumped the version number to 0.3.0.</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2000-10-07</td><td>Shaping with Linux certainly seems to
take off, the authors of this HOWTO are flooded with questions. So we
decided to start a <a href="#mailinglist">mailinglist</a>.</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2000-08-11</td><td>역: 박범석 &lt;darchon@wyzsoft.com&gt;
has started a Korean translation of the HOWTO! You can find it in the
download section</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2000-07-07</td><td>There is now, and has been for some
time, a <a
href=http://www.linux-france.org/prj/inetdoc/i/net/guides/2.4routingfr/>
French translation of the HOWTO</a>! I found an announcement somewhere in the
dark unexplored reaches of my mailbox, which had been there for 2 months.
I'm terribly sorry about this.</td>
<tr><td valign=top>2000-05-26</td><td>Abandoned the 2.4 Networking HOWTO and merged
useful content back into the Advanced HOWTO. I feel bad about this, but the
2.4 Networking HOWTO was not taking off. If anybody feels like it, please
take over. The good news is that the Shaping HOWTO is still progressing and
appears to be very popular.</td>
